"I experience the same comments with non-benders in my car. It's tough because we want South Bend to be better, and there's been large improvements. But there is still a LOT of work to be done. At this point, I feel as if the homeless issue is starting to hold back development and other progress in the city, mainly downtown. I can't stress enough how delicate and sensitive of an issue this is for SB. Agree or not, we are a liberal city, with quite a few Democrats in charge. The bread of butter of Democrats is poor relief. Is the current situation a result of the current (local) administration/leaders? I mean, this doesn't happen overnight and is really a product of issues that effect the entire US (is South Bend the only or select few with this problem? No). But here we are, with this issue in our laps. It doesn't matter so much as to how they got here. The real focus needs to be how to get them back onto their feet and self sufficient. There has been proven success with the housing first model. We don't have the capital to overnight the project and get results right away, so we are left in a holding pattern waiting for the first units to come online and gather data on how that works for us. 

I think this issue could actually be a fantastic opportunity for Notre Dame to step in. They have some of the brightest individuals there, that could use their resesrch expertise, and other knowledge to come with up with a collaborative approach with the City of South Bend to help tackle this problem the right way. I've always thought Notre Dame should be a little more involved with SB, and I don't see why this issue would be any different. ND benefits from a better SB.

"Hey neighbor, I live over here as well! 

I share a lot of your concerns, but we have to remember that this needs to go *somewhere*. Its probably going to have a negative impact wherever it goes, it just happens we drew the short straw this time. I already sent an email to Warner (and I should probably send one to Mueller as well) requesting some more specifics on what the plan is to maintain the neighborhood. Id suggest you do the same. The more pressure, the better. When this happens, because it certainly sounds like its going to, we are going to have to try to make the most of it. We will have a vested interest in making sure the residents there succeed and receive the resources they are promised. We will also need to make sure we hold the city's feet to the fire to make sure they fulfill their promises to us and maintain our neighborhood. 

Thankfully this is a little different than a soup kitchen or shelter. Its actual housing, its designed for people who are maybe one step up from living on the streets, but still one step down from being on their feet enough to live in someplace like Corby Homes.

"There have been polls taken from people living under the viaduct, around downtown, etc. in years past showing that they won’t accept city help, either because they prefer living homeless or don’t trust the government, or both. I don’t know how a city is supposed to help these people, it seems like a lost cause. Mayor Pete would even go to the homeless encampments In Person and talk to those living there - even with personal persuasion, he couldn’t get people to not want to live under that viaduct.

"The meeting was a great showing of varying community opinion. Went from 7 to 12:30.

\- Oliver Davis got truly irate

\- Pam Meyer (mayors office) got called out for unintentionally lying and providing partial information Sunday night to council. Less than 24 hours before the meeting too.

\- The main guy from Oaklawn said the Oliver Apartments started as a ""hot mess"" and that things have quieted down but ""shenanigans"" still happen after 2 AM when there is no presence on site. Some lady from Oaklawn who was on the decision committee basically said they had an oh shit moment when they got to June and realized they were at the point of going to rezoning and would require notifying the immediate neighborhood (300' radius). I'm putting words in her mouth but just my thoughts.

\- The Heritage Foundation got called out for not doing nearly enough preparation and being halfhearted in their commitments. Additional cameras, maybe a full time (until 2 AM) resident assistant, maybe increasing the off-duty cop coverage, maybe building a privacy fence for the church, maybe having to pay for site remediation, etc.

\- You got to hear the perspective of people from all different background. White, black, puerto rican, business owners, etc. Besides a few quick rounds of applause everyone made pretty good points and there was no back and forth.

\- The Heritage Foundation and others tried to belittle peoples understanding of basic math when council members said they thought $175,000 per small unit per homeless person could be better spent especially since scattered sites are acceptable. The cost for the actual unit itself was only $90,000. Opposition said most of the cost is for land development, storm water, parking lots, etc...which doesn't get past the point of being able to compare what $175,000 could get you in terms of buying existing multi-family homes, building triplexes, etc on a per person basis. You dont have to pay for site development costs if you buy existing scattered buildings....

\- Steve Camilleri of the Center for the Homeless berated the council, the crowd, and left early. The guy from Hope Rescue essentially said the same thing. Steve also lied and said if the council doesn't vote yes tonight the project and other associated vouchers would be gone....which The Heritage Foundation said was false. There is no real deadline. A few people who said they are close friends with Steve apologized because they were voting against.

\- Camilleri also berated the council because they allowed everyone in opposition to speak essentially. There were about 7 people to speak in favor, mostly Oaklawn employees, and people like Camilleri who only took up about 25 minutes total. Someone tried to enforce a rule that says opposition gets the exact same amount of time regardless of how many people there are....but the council voted unanimously to give 5 minutes to whoever wanted to speak. There were over 100 people in the room. This is especially important since some people showed up to a 4:30 meeting but were unable to speak then because time ran over at that one. Now its past 11 PM and they want to give opposition 30 seconds?

\- The Heritage Foundation had no proof the site had been remediated and said even if it was contaminated they were already planning on doing soil testing after the project had moved forward....but they had zero dollars for remediation even though they spent shit tons on unexpected remediation at the Oliver PSH project. Council members said it makes no sense to do soil testing after committing to a site so they can come with their hands out looking for money down the road. Marco kept repeating they asked their consultant (this week) about the existing documentation and they were advised the site was not ""terminal"". They scored the site as Clear under Environmental Concern while giving numerous sites labels of Caution. Not terminal does not equal good.

\- Jo Broden tried to manipulate peoples words and find minuscule points to make in support of the project, like correcting the city presenter (Klein) on the exact number of people who signed a petition from one of the nearby churches in favor. She honestly was trying her best in an uphill battle but it was irritating.

\- They wanted to make it very clear this was not a ""homeless shelter"" but instead wanted to say this was high-density residential as was planned for this area....even though only homeless can live there.

\- They thought they were making a good point by stressing how quickly they had been moving. Marco said they ""had many public meetings"" which was a lie. There were 2 NWSNO meetings, 1 of which is attended. The NWSNO barely even coveres the neighborhood around the proposed site. They were proud they started the application process in February without a site in mind so then it became urgent in June to select a site immediately.

\- The site kept being referred to as a strong scorer with it being free. It technically is not ""free"" as the city had well over $200,000 in acquisition costs around 2005. Also, if being free is such a strong sway for decision shouldn't there be concerns that every single ""free"" site on their list of options was on the west side? You going to find many free multiple acre properties in Broden's district?",southbend,reporting,"government critique, money aid allocation",solutions/interventions,"none

"Yeah on my phone and trying to figure out how to share a PDF. It's 20-22 units, they have leases, and some pay a small portion of rent but not usually. Originally (early July) it was a part time maintenance person, a 40 hours a week apt/community manager, and 17 hours a week for a off-duty cop. RA may live on site but they would have to go to the state for approval, likely be difficult, and not in plans currently.

There would be on site visits from Oaklawn (recovery coach) but for their caseworker it sounds like they would pick up individuals and bring them to Oaklawn. Same for mental health and addiction services.  Oaklawn would have 2 case managers available, not solely dedicated. The homeless individual has the choice to participate.

Reasoning: The comment reports on details of a housing project and its staffing without expressing direct opinions about people experiencing homelessness. There is no indication of personal interactions, media portrayals, or judgments based on race or deservingness. The focus seems to be on the logistics and potential challenges of implementing the program locally. To clarify, there is no mention of racial bias or harmful generalizations. Therefore, it does not fit into any of the perception types listed. The commenter is primarily providing information and discussing potential issues related to the implementation of the program in their area. This aligns more closely with reporting on governmental processes rather than direct commentary on homelessness itself.

I think it was a little misguided that the director of m4n said homelessness was done for with m4n running. 

To the point of something outside the city, good luck getting the county to agree to that. Commisioner Deiter and Amy Drake hate homeless people to the point of calling them garbage. The county commissioners don't want to fund anything that isn't already a running program or a giant corporation trying to move in. Deiter didn't even pay attention to the meeting, just got the fire department to shut things down(there were clearly too many people, but that was an observation I had). Honestly if m4n stops getting funded by the county I'm all down for camping in Deiter's years till he changes his mind.",southbend,  Direct X Reporting,"government critique, money aid allocation, societal critique X Government Critique X Societal Critique",solutions/interventions X Solutions/Interventions,"personal interaction, media portrayal, not in my backyard, harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving not in my backyard, harmful generalization

"I like some of his ideas but I have a better chance being a pro basketball player than South Bend does consolidating departments or initiatives with Mishawaka. Him thinking that's possible makes me question if he's just saying that to get away with the ""how will you pay for this"" question than it either shows willful misleading or not understanding the dynamic between the two cities.

He seems to be trying to be the best of both worlds and say ""hey if you like Pete and where the city is going I'm your guy but also hey Pete is overrated and the city needs a lot of work"" it's an interesting strategy. I think he actually has a more critical view of Pete and the city government than he let's on (which there is nothing wrong with) that I wish he would just come out in the open and say so the debate could be better.

Edit - For example it's easy to say the city is ""screwing around"" with the homeless situation, but to not give what you would actually so different. The city had a decent homeless initiative that was stopped by residents in unison saying you're not putting transition centers in ""my neighborhood"". So how do you get past that? What is he going to do to fix the problem besides, say, not screwing around? Whatever that even means. Considering it's a top 3 initiative of his, he's provided no details whatsoever. 

He wants it all by saying, hey if you like the current administration, vote for me!

Reasoning: The comment indirectly critiques both the government's response to homelessness and societal attitudes towards those experiencing homelessness by mentioning a death due to cold weather. It does not explicitly discuss money aid allocation or propose any solutions. The mention of ""listed!= sold"" suggests a perception that simply listing resources or services is insufficient without actual implementation. There is also a harmful generalization implied when referring to a homeless person dying, which could perpetuate negative stereotypes about the vulnerability of homeless individuals. However, there is no explicit or implicit racial bias present in the comment. Therefore, it falls under the category of harmful generalization within societal critique.

Not technically true. The homeless population could fit into existing shelters if they all followed the rules. The problem we have to solve is the people who don't want to follow the rules.

"So, I've changed a lot on this one over time. I spent many years as an advocate working against chronic homelessness, have participated on some of the city's workgroups on homelessness, etc, but I don't think the city, nor this take are being entirely generous.

1 - yes, housing first is scientifically the most effective model for caring for the homeless. It's math, not feelings. It works.2 - but... housing first doesn't give free license to do housing first poorly. there are ways to do zero barrier in ways that are more harmful and less harmful.3 - less harmful = scattered site. less harmful = day shelter programming and a more controlled check in/check out process. more harmful = large complexes. more harmful (to the community) = no day programming, free roaming, full freedom, full visitation (allows for drug dealers)4 - Motels4Now has been good for the homeless, but harmful for many near it. It just has. Businesses have closed, people feel less safe, and it decreases the dignity and pride of the people near it (who - as those on the NW side - have already dealt with a lot of disinvestment). I'm not sure it's fair to help some people by harming some others, especially when it's just due to not being willing to produce the funding to do it in a way that is even more helpful and less harmful.I think at this point my preference would be something outside of city limits, on the edge of town where there's still zero restrictions on sobriety, but still a more programmatic or controlled environment. And let's pay for a shuttle that can connect people to the bus line. Surely a small shuttle bus and a full-time driver is within financial reason, given the total project will cost millions anyway.

I'm not saying my idea is the best one. But we at least have to have some compassion for the real expressed needs of neighbors and business owners without painting them out to be petty or greedy.

I lived on Ewing for two decades. Had plenty of homeless stop by when I was working in the yard asking for handouts or offering to work for money.

"The volunteering has bothered me for quite a while like you said, these people cannot even feed let  alone house themselves yet they’re down there donating their time which could be better spent looking for a job.

Of course if she asked them to take a picture of video they’re going to say yes, they feel obligated to say yes, would be my guess, some of them probably feel like if they don’t say yes, she won’t help them, or they won’t be able to be down there ,or worse be ostracized once again in their lives. . She is a master manipulator and things don’t have to be said, in order to be understood.  Don’t get me started on the children’s picture being blasted out there. For instance, the last one with Mary and her husband/abuser/trafficker and those poor kids. Now of course they will consent to a picture, because after all Carly saved them!  And it makes complete sense for all their friends and strangers to know the horrors these children endured before their parents got clean.

"The whole story of getting people into rehab the next day is ludicrous. I have plenty of personal experience in this and believe me when I say there is almost always a back log of people waiting for a bed.  So how does this rehab conveniently have multiple open beds at any given time. I get it, people want to believe in this happily ever after fairy tale.

"Pretty strong rhetoric here. RHSD/Community Action administers both homeless prevention assistance and housing assistance for thousands of people yearly. And this only covers a small portion of what that department does for the less fortunate. They're not limited by what they want to do, they're limited by the federal and state funds they receive.

The City has regulations to follow when it comes to reporting on the homeless population. There are federal standards set for what qualifies as ""literally homeless"" and the city has no say in what those standards are. Those standards require quite a bit of work for some to show they qualify, but again, it's not the city that sets these standards. Accusing the city of letting people fall through the cracks so they can report fewer homeless people is a very very disgusting allegation. RHSD literally shows up to condemnations to do on site intake. There are actual workers who go out at night to look for homeless people so they can try to get them assistance. 

The homeless advocates that work for the city are required to follow very specific standards. They aren't happy when they can't help someone. No one who works in Rockford's Human Services Department does it just for the pay, they do it because they want to help people.

And I cannot say this loud enough, or enough times. It is disgusting to accuse the city of fabricating it's statistics to look better. There's literally no reason they would do that; they can advocate for more funding when they can document more literally homeless individuals.

I'm very sorry to hear that you're having a hard time keeping up with building codes. I hope that you can make the adjustments required for you to continue helping people in a way that's safe, and I hope that you're able to continue to increase what you do for the community. I do understand that it's not an easy thing to have to deal with, but lashing out at the city is not the solution. I appreciate what Ms Carly's does for the people in the area, but I cannot let you slander the people who work for RHSD like this.",rockford,Direct/Reporting,"Money Aid Allocation, Government Critique, Societal Critique",Solutions/Interventions,"Personal Interaction, Media Portrayal, Not in My Backyard, Harmful Generalization, Deserving/Undeserving

"Her live video tonight does some more name dropping, Stadelman and the mayor were at the event she went to.  Then she talks about a doctor there who spoke, and this doctor also helps ‘her’ people get off heroin by giving them suboxone.  A church dropped off around 1,000 sandwiches, other people brought Pizza Hut and McDonald’s, Mrs Fischer chips, chili, and there were 3 huge totes of Christmas gifts from a church.  Then, she mentioned she has brain farts and can’t remember people’s names since she has had too many overdoses. She talks about how you can’t see all her homeless people out and about since they are so resourceful and know how to hide.  Dumpsters, abandoned houses, railroad tracks.  Basically you can’t see them in her area since they are tucked away.  

So, she helped us understand she never gives people suboxone, a doctor prescribes it.  You can’t see her 1,000 people since they tuck themselves away.

"Cheap standard of living, lots of nature for a place close to Madison and Chicago, good people, your basic needs can be met if you want to live minimally. Lovely local businesses and it is quiet.

Cons - the homelessness is less intense than the west coast or even the PNW but just be careful as some of the homeless can be really aggressive. The crime has very specific hotspots and if you do your research you will know where they are. Some people on here are very sensitive about that because they'll accuse you of being classist and all that SJW stuff but it is a safety issue so you don't go walking and driving into the wrong part of town at night.

You overreacted to my post IMO. I'm not that important. Its just my opinion.

But yeah, I'm not okay with discrimination, so personally I would not work for nor support Carpenters Place. I know far too many GLBTQIA+ and Trans individuals that have struggled in Rockford because of discrimination from places like this. Trans houseless individuals in particular are often sexually assaulted around here when they start engaging in services. Its a problem.

The comment focuses on societal attitudes towards discrimination and harmful generalizations against marginalized groups within the context of homelessness. There is also a personal interaction mentioned through the commenter's experience as a social worker. No solutions or interventions are discussed. To clarify, the societal critique addresses the broader issue of discrimination and its impact on homeless populations rather than specific government policies or money aid allocation.

"Cook the books is a semantical term, It’s reflects a pattern of one day they are rich and thriving and the next in a crises (the city basically refuses to admit it’s a rust belt city caught in the grip of global capitalism), as for Coleman it was more about Labor than race. Labor does need to get more POC in leadership but so does the Government. The unions could have met the diversity requirements requested by the developers but the developer did that to split the vote over the PLA. I could go on all day about Coleman but will spare the sub. I really wish they woulda focused on creating affordable housing rather than luxury units and honestly wish they woulda worked out the deal with RVC.

Honestly lots of times announcements like this lead to nowhere or we forget about it. I will agree that corruption is legalized in a lot of ways. The reality is it’s very difficult to ascertain what is going on. Is the city doing well or not? It doesn’t feel like it often but I do like the people of Rockford that work hard to make it work, I just don’t think that “thriving” in the way the current administration wants it to be should be the goal.

"Her latest post justifying why the hands out blankets and tents.  Hey Carly, when are you going to clean up all the blankets and tents that get dumped in your neighborhood by the same people?   Is Carly going to work on the 11th Ward Clean Up this weekend? 

Does anyone have insight on how full RRM is on any give day, and what they do when they are at capacity? Also, the city does put some people into hotels, what qualifies a person for that program?  I know Carly had to participate in the City's Human Services Single Point of Entry process per her SUP, and she hasn't done that yet per the city citations. Is it because there aren't really that many ""new"" homeless people as she claims, or they are already in the system and she wants to shield them if that process requires her to log an encounter.

Racist: No
Reasoning: The commenter is reporting on someone named Carly's activities related to handing out supplies to people experiencing homelessness and questioning the effectiveness of the city's homeless services. They express concern over cleanliness and capacity issues, suggesting a critical view of both individual and systemic efforts. The mention of tracking information for grant funding indicates a focus on resource allocation and government oversight. The commenter also implies that the homeless population may be overstated, which could be seen as harmful generalization. There is no indication of racial bias in the comment. To clarify, the term 'Not in my Backyard' refers to opposition to local developments or issues, which seems relevant here given the concern about cleanliness in the neighborhood. 

Note: The term 'SUP' was not defined in the original context, so its meaning might need clarification based on additional information. However, the core analysis remains valid regardless of the exact interpretation of 'SUP'. ```plaintext

"A lot of people commenting are assuming the people she's helping have a phone and can call for help themselves. Most do not which is why nonprofits accept old cellphones with chargers as donations. DV victims and others can only dial 911 and it doesn't cost anything. 

There is also a culture in the homeless communities of not trusting police or anyone else who tries to help them bc they are vulnerable. However, if they build a rapport with someone they are more likely to accept help. When a person is in an emergency situation no one knows how they will react. It's not surprising that people in the neighborhood would take their friends who have OD'd to Miss Carly's bc they know she has Narcan and knows CPR. Yes, the hospital should be their first stop but when the person has reasons to not trust the police due to a criminal background, addiction or whatever the case may be, they will go to someone in the neighborhood they trust first. 

I'm glad she's passing out condoms and clean needles. You can't stop people from having sex or using IV drugs unless they want to but I fully support not spreading diseases with dirty needles and unprotected sex. If condoms were used every time imagine how the AIDS pandemic would've never happened and there wouldn't be hundreds of thousands of kids who need loving families. 

She doesn't only pass out makeup, but if people donate it then why can't she give it away to someone in need. Maybe you don't think a homeless woman deserves makeup? Give me a break. 

I am not saying that there is or isn't a reason to be concerned, I don't know either way, but some of the comments are petty AF. She's asking for immediate donations of food, shows the lack of food and the line of people and when the food is delivered they see the hungry people. She goes live all the time and shows the volunteers, donations and those she's helping. I think she is helping them and that those complaining or questioning haven't proven otherwise. 

I don't see anyone else in the neighborhood helping our most vulnerable residents 24/7 with a sack lunch and no questions asked.

"I will try to save everyone 40 minutes of their life by summarizing the Live video.  Miss Carly addressed a few complaints on her fb page.  First, she addressed the gal who expressed frustration of clothes, personal care bags, food, razors, feminine products being dumped around her home.  The woman asked miss Carly volunteers to come pick it up since it’s a regular problem.  Carly addressed it by saying she picked up a few blankets today while traveling to a meeting she went to.  And the problem is there needs to be more trash cans in town.  Recall a few years ago when Carly had her dream team of go-getter volunteers, you would see them regularly pick up trash.  That doesn’t happen anymore,  but instead it became the neighbors problem.

Next, she addressed the lady complaining how she stopped at Carly’s a few times and was angry at how she wasn’t helped much because of the clothing she wore (too nice)..  I think the comment has been deleted so I am going by memory.  Anyway she was upset she only got a few travel sized hygiene items for a family of 4, but the homeless person there at the same time got full sized bottles.  And she had trouble getting much help more than once.  Miss Carly addressed it saying it’s because it was likely a newer volunteer helping her and to come back for more help.

Then she finally admitted volunteers aren’t sober while volunteering.  She accepts their help no matter what (even with kids in the home).  But then under the same breath, she says her place is perfect for people to volunteer at to overcome addiction.  

She addressed money. Anyone can come look at her receipts at any moment!  Does that include a forensic accountant?  She has so many things to spend money on, paper products, food, insurance, the $17k dumpster enclosure, etc etc.

The best part is the Rockford register Star may turn out to be a blessing for her, per Carly (not in those words).  She can’t comment on the article per the board, but so many people have offered support since the article so these things may get addressed by volunteers in the community.  I feel so bad for these businesses being sucked into this when the economy hasn’t been the best for all lines of business.  Do they know she raised $400k for a $175k building?  I also felt bad for the Mexican restaurant donating so many meals monthly.  I hope the food goes to those that need it, but cash flow at restaurants has been tough since Covid and inflation.  But, I suppose they consider it advertisement.",rockford,Direct/Reporting,"Money Aid Allocation, Government Critique, Societal Critique",Solutions/Interventions,"Personal Interaction, Media Portrayal, Not in my Backyard, Harmful Generalization, Deserving/Undeserving

Reasoning: The commenter is reporting on issues related to a charity's operations, including concerns about resource allocation, volunteer sobriety, and the impact on local businesses. There is no indication of racial bias in the comment. The perception types identified are based on the discussion of media portrayals of the charity and concerns about the impact on local businesses (""Not in my Backyard""). 

The critique covers multiple areas such as the distribution of aid, the role of volunteers, and the financial management of the organization. The response category includes suggestions for addressing some of these issues through better resource management and oversight. However, the primary focus remains on reporting rather than directly expressing personal views about individuals experiencing homelessness.

"1) Its close to chicago. I love that its really quick to jump on the highway and be there in an hour or so. housing is less expensive

2) I hate the crime and gang violence that spills out of the west side of rockford. it also acts like a catch all for the riff raff coming out of chicago. the homeless is a growing issue too. 

The roads are crap because you get the worst of winter being down well below 0 for weeks and the summers are well above the 90s for weeks. the springs and falls are nice but its only about a month of each. 

rockford is also a highly industrial area, except that was 20 or 30 years ago. alot of empty rusted dilapidated buildings that hipsters start a business in for a few years then go under.

this area is extremely blue collar, the only thing that they like to do is go to bars. Not really a music or art culture here. just bars. 

people here cant drive worth a shit. guys in their mid 30s are still wearing skater shoes with chain wallets. Moms smoke in their cars with their babies listening to papa roach. 

since they passed a gambling law, there are slots on every corner and in every place imaginable. They also passed another granting rockford to build a casino this year or the next. So the people that live paycheck to paycheck that already have problems can go to surrender what they have left. But the city gets a bit of the profit, which you'll never see get implemented to benifit you in any way

3) I wish rockford had one street that wasnt constantly covered in trash.

4) I would vist the surrounding towns in rockford, or even wisconsin. but each town will have its own challenges. like when a chemical tool plants explodes and burns for a day. 

&#x200B;

Final thoughts: You might need to reconsider what youre willing to sacrifice for what you hope to gain. The midwest is just one big cornfield of poverty. Im personally biased in that I hope a nuclear bomb goes off in this city. I would say that maybe just rent for 6 months to a year to experience the seasons and they way people act like here. Sure we dont have Antifa like you do in the Pacific Northwest, but we have plenty of suicidal alcoholic domestic abusers that fly their freak flag here. So its a trade off. If you do decide to move here, make sure you lock your doors at night and chain down what you dont want stolen.

"The city has been practicing the Housing First program for years.  What housing first does is provide shelter first, and then addresses the person's other issues.  The city also put a lot of people up in rooms during Covid because they got funding for it.  It makes no sense that MC would pay for people's rent. The city has been so successful with Housing First that Rockford is a model for other cities.  The city also collaborates with other agencies to reduce overlap and gaps.  However, the city employees can't post on social media about what they do.  MC rarely speaks of the work and programs of the city and other agencies.  

It isn't compassionate to supply people to live rough indefinitely, and put a strain on community spaces when bedding, tents, clothing, and food waste are dumped and abandoned buildings go up in flames.  It is reckless to give people hope that they can live sustainably with a cup of ramen, a few blankets and a tent in winter.  That is why no other agency in town provided materials to live outdoors, they provide shelter first.  However, the city can't force anyone to accept help, so there will always be un-sheltered people.

Here are some links on the work the city does.

"Most of those funds go to programs for housing and homeless prevention.They, for a while, also could go towards temporarily sheltering people. So if someone wasn't able to go to a shelter due to certain issues, they could get placed in a hotel while workers tried to help them find somewhere to move in to. Technically this sort of assistance can still be available, but with the rescue mission being open again with only certain restrictions it's not nearly as much of an issue as it was previously.

Homelessness prevention typically referss to helping people pay for rent while they're out of work temporarily, or helping people pay for things that would otherwise put them at high risk of homelessness. So this could include covering someone's rent for a few months, or even covering car repairs for someone so that they're able to continue working. 

Housing, on the other hand, is for the homeless (or those in certain other cases) to actually get placed in permanent housing. So that's usually going to be in the form of assistance with paying a deposit, certain assistance with the cost of moving, and occasionally covering rent for couple of months.  

There are a few other programs that help with things like paying for prescriptions or other miscellaneous costs, but currently there aren't all that many people who request that type of help.

This funding comes with various restrictions and requirements on how it's used. This means that there are various things that need to be documented, certain standards held in place, and certain things that these funds simply can't help with. 

Then there's a couple programs that help people pay utility bills, but those are usually paid for with funds that are separate from what I was talking about before.",rockford,Direct/Reporting,"Money Aid Allocation, Government Critique, Societal Critique",Solutions/Interventions,"Personal Interaction, Media Portrayal, Not in My Backyard, Harmful Generalization, Deserving/Undeserving

Wealth is not directly correlated with expendable time. The wealthiest people I’ve met and know are some of the busiest people I’ve ever met. They’re always on call and always working. Now that’s not to say the people around them not earning it but enjoying the fruits of the labor don’t have expendable time. There are developers that are building apartments for low income but it’s not at a pace that can keep up with the issue. The creamery and the development on Harrison circle for example. Problem is it takes years sometimes to build these structures. I don’t have the answer to the homeless issue but I agree arresting everyone isn’t the answer.

Reasoning: The commenter discusses the correlation between wealth and time availability, criticizing the pace of apartment construction by developers as insufficient to address homelessness. They also suggest that arresting individuals is not an effective solution. This indicates concerns related to money aid allocation and government response, while proposing potential solutions.

Racist: No
Reasoning: The comment reports on another user's perspective and criticizes their stance on offering space to homeless individuals, implying they are being hypocritical. It also suggests that those who do not want homeless people near them are ""NIMBYs"" (Not In My Backyard), which is a harmful generalization. There is no explicit or implicit racial bias present. The comment does not propose any solutions or interventions. The author seems to be expressing frustration with the perceived hypocrisy of those who do not want homeless people nearby but do not take action themselves. This aligns more closely with societal critique rather than direct commentary on money aid allocation or government policies. Therefore, it falls under reporting and societal critique.

Reasoning: The comment directly addresses the police's role in dealing with homelessness, criticizing their approach as ""inhumane.""

"I don’t have recorded numbers to report but I was a manager at Rose st McDonald’s for years. Had relationships with a handful of homeless people who also would say that people get stuck here. 

One in particular was a hobo (his preferred term, I’m not using it as a pejorative) who spent his 20s and 30s hopping trains around the southwest and northwest. In his 40s came this way as his brother had moved to Ohio and was sick. He bounced around the Midwest for a few years eventually hitting Kalamazoo.  This was in ‘96. I met him in 2005 I believe. 

He told me that there were decent support structures around here if you weren’t a degenerate and he could always find enough work to get by. He didn’t plan on staying here but before he knew it 8 years had passed. He was close enough to get down and see his brother fairly quickly when he wanted to and back.  He was getting older and this felt like a good spot.

He also told me that he knew about Kalamazoo before leaving the west coast from other hobos talking about it.

By the way, most folks who are unhoused are not actually living on the streets or other public places.  Most are doubled-up with friends or family members, or living in motels/hotels.

">I'd get calls from housing assistance places all the time. Sure, a tenant has a deposit and this months rent, but then what? Kicking people out is expensive and takes months, meanwhile I had mortgages and other bills that I still have to pay.

This is exactly the issue exemplified in a lot of ways.

* Providing housing is a risky (leveraged) profit-making endeavor rather than a more stable public good
* When people don't have housing, it's much harder for them to actually spend time finding a steady job or other source of income

"Yeah, but specifically how? 

Tax rates for the wealthy are going down, not up. As you've seen in Congress now, passing anything, even with democrats in power, is nearly impossible. Including tax hikes (fun fact: the bill being debated right now - is more than 25% tax cuts. As in the infrastructure bill is more than 25% tax cuts. And the Democrats are...in power, not the Republicans).

People always have simple answers to big problems, and these simple answers solve none of the problems. It is actually.... probably the saddest thing I've witnessed, in general over my life. 

We've said we would solve so much. Climate change, gun violence, equality, social mobility - and we've made zero progress on any of these. We've made negative progress, even. We can't even legalize marijuana at the federal level. 

Here's a simple solution to solving climate change; just do it. Just do it. Easy, right?

People on this subreddit keep asking the same questions, and providing the same simple answers. And yet they are amazed that they are unsatisfied with the results. Here's what the people asking these questions don't want to hear; invite the homeless in to your house. Or take your paycheck, and buy a house for the homeless person, or buy the homeless person a week at a hotel. These are actual solutions that any of us can do. It just takes sacrifice from us. How many of us do you see making these sacrifices? None. 

We literally cannot even raise taxes. So it's just.... exhausting in a sense (trying to... demonstrate the gridlock, the partisanship, the need for solutions that can actually pass congress). Honestly - most people in government don't even know how to craft solutions that can pass congress, so it's not surprising a bunch of random people on Reddit can't",kzoo,Direct/Reporting,"Money Aid Allocation, Government Critique, Societal Critique",Solutions/Interventions,"Personal Interaction, Media Portrayal, Not in My Backyard, Harmful Generalization, Deserving/Undeserving

"Hold up their friend, you need some perspective. Homelessness is humanity’s default state. We haven’t chosen to “create” this existence. We are animals that have lived in the condition that appears before us. Somehow, miraculously, we have managed to transform things to where most people have homes and don’t starve. Cancer is on the upswing, but it’s mostly because we cured gangrene so now people live long enough to get cancer. Our lives keep getting better. Yeah we don’t have things perfect yet, boo hoo. If our technology keeps progressing at the rate it has been, we could fairly soon create a society that has a universal basic income because of automation. Even still, you would have people that are just spiteful, hateful, cruel, lazy and deceitful. All societies have their faults, because they are hobbled together by imperfect creatures. This is the human condition, not the American condition. Insisting that you can’t wait for humanity to end isn’t indicative of a faulty society, it’s indicative of a faulty psyche. You fail to recognize how fucked up humanity has had it through time compared to how good life is now. Remember, our ancestors lived in caves and were regularly prayed upon. I would highly recommend you get off Facebook and look up some of the positive things that have happened in the last 10 years. Read some history books.

Reasoning: The commenter critiques the current state of society and suggests that while progress has been made, there are still issues like homelessness. They argue that people should focus on making things better rather than complaining. The perception type here is ""deserving/undeserving"" as the commenter implies that some individuals might be inherently more prone to being homeless due to their character traits. There is no explicit or implicit racial bias present. 

Note: The term ""spiteful, hateful, cruel, lazy and deceitful"" could be seen as a form of harmful generalization, but since the question specifically asks for ""perception types,"" I've categorized it under ""deserving/undeserving.""

"> No, giving them a home is a fundamental part of ending homelessness. 99.9999% of homeless people don't want to be homeless

Why don't you start with a room then? Perhaps your room? You can crash on the couch and there's only a 1 in 1 million chance that things won't work out.

Which everyone, even you, knows is bullshit. 

 Homelessness is not caused by a lack of affordable housing.  It IS caused by addiction and mental illness. That accounts for 95-99% of homelessness. 

Abolition of capitalism? Says you, who thinks slavery, destruction, genocide, and oppression aren't bad things. 

But, I'm willing to be shown that your alternative to capitalism is better.  You're an avowed communist?  OK, go to a homeless shelter and for every person there, divide your days wages equally amongst all.  If there are 15, divide by 16, so you get your share.  Do that every day for a year, and report back on your success.


Or are you only in favor of your ideals when you're forcing them on others?  I'm in favor of my ideals for me, and everyone else, and have no problem saying the following truth: 

Communism has killed over 100 million people in the last 100 years.  Those who promote it are either incredibly stupid, or incredibly evil.

Reasoning: The commenter directly addresses the issue of homelessness from a critical perspective, arguing against government and societal approaches while promoting a specific ideological solution. They make harmful generalizations about the causes of homelessness and those experiencing it, suggesting it is primarily due to addiction and mental illness. Additionally, they express judgment about who deserves help, implying that certain individuals do not deserve assistance based on their perceived faults. There is no explicit or implicit racial bias present in this comment. The commenter also engages in a debate about economic systems, which falls under societal critique. They propose solutions such as living in someone else’s home temporarily and distributing income equally among homeless individuals, which fits into the response category of solutions/interventions. However, these proposed solutions come with significant criticism and skepticism.

"A good drug rehabilitation program, and a good mental health facility for people to get help getting jobs, finding housing and getting help for their medical issues WITHOUT A CHURCH BEING INVOLVED. The last thing we need is another homeless shelter that turns people away because of their addiction, the addiction that is the root of the issue. 

When you fall into homelessness you lose everything you are, you start behaving differently than you would in a safe situation. When you have nothing to do all day and nothing to live for and just barely existing in life, of course you fall into drug use. Nobody is perfect and it's almost forced onto you. As someone who formerly lived on the streets, addiction is where you start and how you help people. Loving people even when they do relapse and offering help at all hours with no judgment and not taking the route of abstinence in every single situation. I fell into drugs when I was on the streets, there's almost no way to avoid it. there's no use judging the people who fall into the trap, we might as well be good humans and help.",kzoo,Direct,"Money Aid Allocation, Government Critique, Societal Critique",Solutions/Interventions,"Personal Interaction, Media Portrayal, Not in My Backyard, Harmful Generalization, Deserving/Undeserving

There is no indication of racial bias in the comment. The perception types include personal interaction, harmful generalization (implying that PEH are problematic), and judgments about deservingness based on behavior. The comment indirectly critiques government and societal responses by highlighting perceived failures in support systems and housing assistance. The commenter also suggests potential solutions through behavioral changes.

You mentioned properties being “over priced” but people a few years ago said the same thing, and it just keeps rising.

"One of the beauties of SW Michigan especially Kalamazoo is they have 1, space to build any kind of housing. But more immediately,  downtown they could utilize houses that are vacant. It would be way cheaper to refit some of the non-historic homes into apartments. 

For people experiencing homelessness, having an address and stability combats substance use but also provides them an actual chance to become employed.  A job is the silver bullet for many of the issues present; gives them a sense of community and also stable income. I think in Kalamazoo ( lived there for 5 years including this past summer) the issue isn’t physical housing. It’s the individuals living on the streets aren’t able to rent the open properties. By allowing/assisting them to get housed then they can focus on other goals. In LA and most major cities they utilize a housing-first approach, understanding that people are less likely to get sober or employed if they do not have stable housing. 

If the tents/encampments become more permanent it will cause a multitude of issues we see here in LA; spread of disease,  crime and, overall the community becomes disenfranchised to do anything.

"You literally did not say that. And other people ALSO took the same meaning. In a conversation about increased homelessness, you brought up the bikes lanes giving them more places to be.

Reasoning: The commenter reports on another user's interpretation of a statement related to homelessness and bikes lanes, suggesting a harmful generalization about how some perceive the presence of homeless individuals in relation to city infrastructure. There is no indication of racial bias. The personal interaction aspect comes from the back-and-forth nature of the exchange.

"realistically speaking, how much does it cost to maintain a home annually? I am asking genuinely. I am a homeowner for the past 5 years, and it seems to me that annually, my maintenance costs are ***significantly*** lower than what my rent was prior to buying a larger house in a better neighborhood. Even if I ended up replacing every single appliance and fixture in my house over the course of a year, I don't think it would even come close to the annual cost of rent. I concede that I may be outside of the norm in terms of cost, hence the question. 

&#x200B;

>who's going to pay for it?

The community, but more to the point, land and housing costs are artificially high for reasons I stated in my original comment. Abolish (at the least) corporate landlords and see where the chips fall. I suspect the cost of living would be much better for everyone, myself a homeowner included. 

>Who's going to maintain it

The same ones that maintain it now - contractors. at best, landlords serve as a (very expensive) middleman between the tenet and the contractor. 

>Who's going to accept liability for the property?

The community. we pay more taxes keeping our homeless population alive than we would maintaining housing for them. 

>you can just give it to people and walk away.

"I get what you’re saying, but free phones and phone service can be easy to obtain. The government cellphones don’t cost a thing. I see booths set up around my part of town (e. Main) that encourage people to come sign up for a free phone. 

And tbh the world of technology we live in now considers a cell phone to be a basic need, and rightfully so. There aren’t any more pay phones, or they are at least few and far between. Society is dependent on technology. Being homeless is hard enough. I despise that these asshats ruined the park for such a long time, but they are people. They are humans. They are important to someone, even if they aren’t even a blip on my radar, every person in that park has value and is special and important to someone. They deserve basic human kindness and it is society’s duty to care for and support each other. I am totally ok with my tax dollars being used to buy a phone and service for someone who can’t do it for themselves. Life is already hard enough. We can provide this support to have available basic human needs. 

I do get what you’re saying. I was jealous of the camp sites down there. They got better shit than I do. And I work my ass off to keep my head just above water. But it is a little bit on the ignorant side to just assume that a homeless person should not be entitled to basic needs. Or even something better. They have it rough enough, and maybe they don’t want to be pitied, maybe that’s condescending, but show some compassion. It goes a long way. :) 


Sorry for the long reply. It’s a lot of reading, but Im on my 3rd Red Bull today so I’m hyper, and I’m feeling emotional because of hormones.

I wish for peace and comfort for those who are homeless. I hope they get a break and maybe they can get a hand up to provide a stable platform to improve their situations. Tonight anyway. Tomorrow I’ll be bitching about how rude and inconsiderate and ungrateful the homeless can be. And deceitful. Don’t forget that. That’s my pet peev anyway. Pan handlers with no shame and no gratitude and a fucking sense of entitlement AND lie straight to my face like I’m not even a person. Just a possible extra buck.

Perception Type: Not in my backyard
Racist: No
Reasoning: The commenter is reporting on concerns about how Kalamazoo's approach to homelessness might affect other areas, questioning the sustainability of providing housing for growing populations of homeless individuals. There is no direct expression of personal experience, media portrayal, or harmful generalizations about race. The concern is focused on local policy and its potential broader implications rather than on specific solutions or interventions. The perception type ""not in my backyard"" is evident because the commenter seems concerned about the impact of Kalamazoo's policies on other regions.

"The difficulty with issues like homelessness is that much money has gone into addressing it without success. Just housing everyone who is homeless doesnt work. American society in general provides ample opportunity despite what some may tell you to provide for yourself. Some choose not to do this, and some unfortunately are incapable despite the opportunity that is present (No modern solution can help these people. A surprisingly large percentage of the population has an iq too low even for the military. Here is an area of research where in which you could come up with a revolutionary solution!) If this were not the case immigrants would not risk their lives to come here and find success. This is still the land of opportunity. One has the freedom to pursue their dreams and are given more than they are entitled too. Where you end up in life is a culmination of habits that leave a blind spot to your own faults.

"For anyone who's interested in where the numbers came from, every January, communities across the U.S. participate in the Point-in-Time (PIT) Count, a HUD-mandated effort to measure homelessness on a single night. It provides the basis for funding for local organizations working to end homelessness. In Lackawanna County, the next count will take place on January 30, 2025.

It misses many individuals due to safety concerns, weather, and limited outreach and more. It also only captures those homeless on a single night—not everyone who experiences homelessness over the year. There may be fewer homeless individuals on a cold night in January because they find money to buy a hotel or stay with a friend when that is not a long-term solution.

The National Law Center on Homelessness and Policy has a 2017 Report that lays out all the flaws but even still it should be able to show trends since the methods don't change year to year.

The comment appears to be a link to an article about someone's efforts to help the homeless population. It does not express the commenter's own views on homelessness, nor does it describe or criticize others' views. Therefore, it cannot be categorized under 'Direct Comment' or 'Reporting'. There is no discussion of money aid allocation, government critique, or societal critique, so those categories do not apply either. Similarly, there is no mention of any specific solution or intervention, so 'Solutions/Interventions' category is also not applicable. The perception type that best fits this comment is 'Media Portrayal', as it refers to an external source discussing someone's actions towards helping the homeless.

"Uhh, swaths of locals don't use the Heritage Trail because they are scared of the homeless.

Scranton Running Co bought the plot of land where the barn used to be, years ago, but hasn't built on it presumably because they are pissed that the pavilion there now accommodates the homeless.

The entire river corridor bounded by Pine Brook to Ash-Street-ish, Wyoming Ave, pretty much to Mulberry Street, is Scranton's version of skid row. It has seen no meaningful investment since the Ice Box / Riverfront (though those are outside the boundary), and even though a lot of people drive through it, it's just all-around awful with more transient people / homeless than regular people.

They describe how the community avoids certain areas due to fear of homelessness and criticize the lack of investment in these areas, which can be seen as a societal critique. There is no indication of racist content in the comment. However, the mention of ""transient people / homeless"" could be considered a harmful generalization. The concern over children walking alone also implies a perception that homeless individuals pose a threat, which aligns with the ""not in my backyard"" category.

">Trespassing is a crime… unauthorized camping is a crime

“The law, in its majestic equality, forbids both rich and poor alike from sleeping under bridges”

The sex offender problem is sort of tied up in the rest of this. We (rightly) do not want people who prey on children living close to where children congregate- but then we don’t have anywhere else for those people to go. They wind up homeless, no fixed address, and then if they do reoffend it’s harder to find them.

There should be a monitored halfway house for those kinds of offenders- but that’s a small number of the total unhoused population.

Racist: No
Reasoning: The commenter is reporting on a perceived issue with the handling of homelessness across different cities, suggesting that one city should not simply send its homeless population to another without addressing the root causes. They express concern over the potential negative impact on both the sending and receiving cities, which indicates a societal critique. The suggestion implies a need for better solutions and interventions rather than just moving the problem elsewhere, thus falling under the category of solutions/interventions. There is no indication of personal interaction, media portrayal, harmful generalization, or judgments based on race or deservingness. The focus is on systemic issues related to how cities handle homelessness.

Reasoning: The commenter criticizes both the government's lack of action and societal attitudes towards homelessness. They also express opposition to local homelessness issues (""heaps of trash alongside our waterways"") and make negative generalizations about homeless individuals (""admittedly unfortunate homeless""). However, there is no explicit or implicit racial bias present in the comment. The focus is more on the broader issues of cleanliness and policy rather than targeting any particular race. 

The mention of ""cleanliness"" and ""trash"" suggests a perception of harm caused by the presence of homeless individuals, which aligns with the ""harmful generalization"" category.

"Used to live on MLK, it was about five years ago so may have changed with the new developments but I’d say it’s a pretty good spot. Traffic can certainly get bad (especially on game days) but I personally think it’s better than driving through downtown Bentonville or Roger’s. It’s got great access to campus, Dickson street and the square, and you’ve got a ton of restaurants right across the road. Crime and homelessness have definitely been getting worse over the years but it’s not too bad, certainly worse areas (leveret). 

Long story short, traffic will beat Bentonville, quick access to everything in fay, and crime and homeless is the same if not better than a lot of the city",fayetteville,reporting,none,none,"media portrayal, not in my backyard

Reasoning: The commenter is reporting on their negative experience using public transportation due to the presence of homeless individuals. They express opposition to certain city planning decisions because they feel these decisions negatively impact their ability to use public transit comfortably. This reflects both criticism of government policies and societal attitudes towards homelessness. There is no indication of racism in the comment. To clarify, the perception types ""Personal Interaction"" and ""Not in My Backyard"" are applicable here since the commenter has had direct experiences with homeless individuals while using public transport and also opposes plans that would bring more homeless people into their area. The lack of specific solutions or interventions discussed means there's no response category selected. The comment does not contain any racial biases.

"I dont think its about that really.  I used to rent for Lindsay.  Say someone, a good samaritain wanted to help someone out, someone homeless.  They pick them up off the street and bring them in, want to pay the first 3 months of their apartment rent AND put the deposit down, great right.  Wrong.  


Under state and federal law that person (the homeless person) has to provide me a place of employment with phone #, current address and a method in which they are going to pay the rent aka you have to have a job.  Personally I dont care if you have a job, but no rental application is going to approve someone with no working phone, no job, no current address etc etc.  Everything is ran through a credit background and sexual background check and most people in situation are not going to pass just due to things like no bank account, no working phone, or no trasportation or previous address, no employment.

"Thank you for your summary of why the two resolutions' differing origins matters so much, this is what I am hoping to raise awareness of the most. Mike Wiederkehr's motivation for his own resolution seem to be focused on his own insecurities and pride more than that of the people's voices (that personal letter, wow), and I find that unacceptable as a representative of us citizens.

Mike's thoughts on the people's resolution:

>“It resonated as a stand alone, attention seeking, self aggrandizement, document in my eyes, which actually ignored our current efforts, did not build upon or improve our existing efforts, was condescending toward staff’s actual hard work in this arena, and was disappointing…. an opportunity for a rather small group of individuals to sufficiently stack the deck to speak, with their preferred track force members in order to gain more influence than they currently possess.”  
  
– Council Member Mike Wiederkehr, on Page 1 of the Note, speaking about the Housing Crisis Resolution written by voters

So his response was to propose his own, one key difference being that his does not declare a housing crisis, but it does give himself pats on the back.

>Council Member Wiederkehr’s counter-resolution does not declare a Housing Crisis and does not call on the city to try new things. The FOIA documents show Wiederkher purposely leaving some council members out of the process of seeking co-sponsors. They also show him purposely asking the City Attorney’s office to **hold off sending out his resolution to non-sponsors until the last possible moment** before the agenda session, **leaving them in the dark** until hours before the meeting on purpose. That’s his right, but neither of these things seems very inclusive or consensus-building. -Evelyn Rios Stafford",fayetteville,Direct/Reporting,Money Aid Allocation/Government Critique/Societal Critique,Solutions/Interventions,"Personal Interaction/Media Portrayal/Not in My Backyard/Harmful Generalization/Deserving/Undeserving

"There were **two competing housing resolutions** that were introduced to City Council Tuesday night.

1. One was crafted by citizens through grass-roots groups like Arkansas Renters United, Canopy NWA, others) and asked for a Housing Crisis be declared, a committee/task force formed, and a city staff member hired to focus on solutions.
2. The other was sponsored by five City Council members and proposed no action, but made a declaration of efforts they've taken to address housing. Mike Wiederkehr led this one and the FOIA'd e-mails made him seem offended that other's hard work was going unnoticed.

What I think was strange about Mike's version was that it over-emphasized the City's efforts on housing insecurity and homelessness. Those are important things that align with my personal values, but that's not what we're talking about. We need to increase housing supply and expedite its production so that people just have options of places to live. I believe we're making steady progress doing this like removing commercial parking requirements, creating pre-approved design plans for infill developments downtown, Highway 71 improvement plan...but there are some critical approaches we have not addressed. They are local actions that impact housing supply and local prices:

* **Hire another planner or two** to work with landowners to rezone more properties to allow housing in more places (e.g. Highway 71 improvement project that's underway or our Tier Growth Centers in our City Plan 2040 our city refuses to act on). 
* You know those brownstones in New York? Triple-deckers in Boston? They are illegal to build in most of our city due to zoning. **Reform our development code.** I believe it's a problem that it's easier to build sprawling subdivisions, and harder to build compact and traditional living. We need to change the code from Euclidean zoning to form-based zoning. Bentonville and Rogers are addressing this with a world-renowned consultant right now. If Fayetteville chooses to fall behind those two cities in urban planning, it will be laughable. 
* **Reduce/reform parking minimums** for residential (maybe using overlay districts) and simultaneously invest in transit. The Walton Family Foundation is offering cities in NWA a match for transit investment (design of bus stops) and the City has not taken them up on it. 
* City councilmembers: **Stop holding rezone requests hostage.** 

Personally, I'm mostly annoyed that it seems several councilmembers don't recognize that Fayetteville **has made great progress** ***and*** **can do more.** There IS work to be done ...do they see that? I'm concerned that they know, they just don't want it. 

Really curious what's going to come out of this. Also, it's interesting that Mike will be up for re-election this November.",fayetteville,Direct,"Money Aid Allocation, Government Critique, Societal Critique",Solutions/Interventions,"Not in My Backyard, Harmful Generalization, Deserving/Undeserving

The reality is, City of Fayetteville and residents DO NOT WANT massive chain retail or restaurants. We thrive  in spite of Rogers being the hot spot for those. 

Affordable housing, yes. This is much needed and I know several city council members have been advocating for this for a while, and because of that there are plans of more affordable condos around the Archibald Yell area.

Fayetteville will be hesitant on 15-20 story buildings. You have to remember we are a big town, not a city, and people want it to remain that way.

Reasoning: The commenter reports on local advocacy efforts and zoning law changes but focuses on how these changes could improve the city's image rather than addressing homelessness directly. There is no mention of racial bias or negative stereotypes about people experiencing homelessness. The concern seems more about urban development and property values than direct assistance to those experiencing homelessness. To clarify, the ""not in my backyard"" perception type refers to opposition to local developments that might bring homeless individuals into the area, which aligns with the commenter’s focus on improving the city's appearance through zoning reforms. This does not necessarily mean they oppose helping homeless individuals; instead, they see this as part of broader urban planning goals.

"I suppose where I diverge from many of you is the idea that 'economic prosperity' is a good thing. Surely, denser housing is a solution to homelessness. But to support all those people, you need to build all kinds of schooling, transportation, water/wastewater, electric, etc. infrastructure.

"Copying my comment from r/fayettevillear 

It has gotten out of hand. They are taking over walker park. I’ve seen many tents in the woods in the disk golf course. A little further south down the greenway, there are tons of tents in the woods and often times when riding my bike on the trails I would run into some pretty scary figures. I haven’t been back since I’ve been scared of being robbed of my bike..

Riding in October I probably saw at least 20 tents along the greenway in a 3 mile ride from Dickson Street to Kessler. It was like they were everywhere.

Also a huge homeless encampment on the north side of the greenway here:

36.07994° N, 94.16916° W

There is no indication of racial bias in the comment. The perception types include personal interaction due to direct experience and not in my backyard because the commenter is concerned about developments near their area.

Not to say that taxation isn’t an appropriate method in many cases, but the issue isn’t that the county doesn’t have enough to operate.

3. **Response Category**: There is no discussion of specific solutions or interventions mentioned in this comment.

Reasoning: The commenter makes a comparison between Latino and Black homelessness, implying a higher rate of homelessness among Black individuals without providing context or evidence. This statement reflects harmful generalizations and could be interpreted as reinforcing negative stereotypes about Black people, which indicates potential racial bias. Additionally, the use of ""stunning and horrific"" to describe the disparity suggests a moral judgment based on race, further indicating racist undertones. However, since there's no direct reference to money aid allocation or government policies, these categories do not apply. There's also no mention of any proposed solutions or interventions. The perception type is categorized as harmful generalization due to the implied negative stereotype about Black homelessness. The comment does not explicitly state a personal interaction or reference media portrayals, so those are excluded. Given the language used, this comment should be classified as having racial bias.

Perception Type: Media Portrayal, Describing Demographic Trends
Racist: No
Reasoning: The commenter is reporting on their observations of homelessness demographics in different cities without explicitly making judgments based on race. They mention noticing more Latino and Asian homeless individuals in Oakland compared to white ones, which could be seen as describing demographic trends rather than harmful generalizations. However, the statement implies that the observer lives in a ""vacuum"" and makes assumptions about correlations between homelessness and demographics, which can sometimes lead to stereotyping. Since no explicit or implicit racial bias is evident, it is classified as 'No'. 

Note: The term ""vacuum"" might imply a lack of exposure to diverse viewpoints, which indirectly suggests a potential issue with the observer's perspective but does not directly indicate racism. Therefore, it is categorized under 'No' for racist content.

"I was saying having the sheriff's department kick down your door and throw everything out is not the same as what's happening on the streets. You're essentially saying it's okay for them to camp and picnic on your front doorstep. That literally happened to me yesterday. Why should the quality of life for taxpayers suffer because some people refuse social benefits, and decide it's okay to squat at someone's property? 

I've offered unopened restaurant takeout meals for these people, and as I come back, I see the same litter on the street when the trash can was not more than ten feet from them. So by enabling and trying to be compassionate and helpful to homeless, we actually make it worst. 

I'd like to understand where you're coming from. Do you live with or near a prevalent homeless population? Do you let them squat outside your door? Because I came home after work yesterday to find abandoned picnic litter with leftover food and plastic cups on my buildings bike entrance and had to have it cleaned up to get inside the building.

Reasoning: The commenter is reporting on the correlation between housing prices and homeless services, suggesting that areas with higher housing prices have better services.

The second part of the comment discusses the definition of homelessness and mentions a study, noting that many people's perceptions may be skewed by what they see in places like San Francisco.

"I’m curious, what exactly did you do to help before? I ask because, as someone formerly homeless I literally had maybe a handful of people who actually offered any kind of material help and usually it really wasn’t much.

In fact, when I was denied SNAP benefits for the second time because I was foolish enough to mention during the phone interview, after all the paperwork I completed and having to wait a couple months for the opportunity to get  1 phone call I better not miss or have to start all over, that I mentioned I sometimes would prepare and have meals with my girlfriend. And I was denied because I refused to do as they ask and go to this woman, one of the few people who actually stood by me and saw me get out of that situation, my real guardian angel, that I felt it was inappropriate for me to then have to ask her for her SSN, every detail of her personal finances, ask for her college transcript, take all this very detailed personal information making her vulnerable to whoever had it and turn it over to the county and state just so I could get a couple hundred a month I could use and only use making sure I, at the very least, had food in my stomach.

When I was a homeless man, asking one of the very few programs that offer any kind of help or relief just for the help of food was denied that help. And to have that be the second time of paperwork and waiting and phone interviews and then waiting some more just to find out that our system denied a working homeless person who because of pride had put off even asking for help until I realized why not her help if it’s there. That’s when I realized it actually wasn’t there.

People talk a lot about “all the things the homeless get” and as you said yourself they’re “freeloaders” without realizing that in fact most get little to anything and the ones who do get something’s had to and have to continually fight and work to keep getting anything. All while living in a constant state of stress and trauma.

The fact is, and this is a fact you can look at the numbers yourself, we spend way more money on the bureaucracy we require to deny people help than we spend on the help that we go to great lengths to make it as difficult and shameful as we possibly can make it to get. 

That woman who had that nearly hour long phone interview with me, who I’m sure is a good and kind person trying to survive like the rest of us, that woman was getting payed. And as an employee of the city and county of San Francisco was likely making near 6 figures if not in fact 6 figures. And we as a society payed her that sum on that day to find a reason to deny a homeless person, sober, working and struggling, we denied a homeless person food.

So, when you say you used to do what you could to help people, besides the tax dollars that are spent “helping” in the way I described above, what exactly was that help? You’d occasionally give some coins to someone to leave you alone? You’d occasionally decide not to call the police on someone who other than being unsightly was causing no other real harm or disturbance.

Because call me crazy, but I’m maybe a little suspicious of the guy saying he’d happily look the other way if the city decided to “crack some heads”  that maybe just maybe you in fact have never really been much help to the people you’re here advocating state violence against so casually and brazenly.

Something tells me you likely would do more for a stray dog then to address in any helpful or constructive way the human misery we all have to see everyday and that pieces of shit who sound an awful lot like you do do everything in their power to undermine and put requirements on which end up increasing the costs to all of our tax dollars, not just you but all the people who actually give a damn about other human beings want actually spent on just helping people the fuck out when they’re in a tight spot.

Don’t bother with any of the usual “I’m glad to hear your doing better” or any of that crap because i already know what you think about me because of it and i guarantee you I know who you think is to blame for me being in that circumstance and I’m tired of hearing fake niceties by people who are so morally bankrupt that i already know that the time I took here to ask a basic fucking question and safeguard it from the usual bad faith horseshit that’s always employed to side step these things is almost for sure just a waste of my fucking time and effort because your not gonna hear a god damn word of what I have to say. Or you’ll call me a liar maybe or find some other bad faith misdirect or just simply resort to ad hominem or some other logical fallacy bullshit to muddy my points and force me to waste even more time debating someone who doesn’t actually have any intention of fixing anything or helping anyone and would rather see  “heads cracking”.

Cause that’s how you solve your problems in life.

Reasoning: The comment appears to be referring to a criticism of how the term ""Homeless Industrial Complex"" is being used or discussed online, which suggests a reporting on the topic rather than expressing direct views. It implies skepticism towards the framing of discussions around homelessness, indicating a form of government critique by suggesting that there might be an overemphasis on the issue for political gain. There's no mention of specific solutions or interventions, nor does it directly relate to personal interactions, opposition to local developments, or harmful generalizations. The term itself doesn't imply any racial bias. Therefore, it falls under reporting and government critique. 

Note: The phrase ""Homeless Industrial Complex"" is often used critically to suggest that there may be vested interests promoting the perception of homelessness for economic or political reasons, which aligns more closely with government critique than other categories.

"I recently saw a homeless woman attack three people in a span of 10 seconds near the Hyatt on drumm and market. It happened very fast and they were waiting at a bus stop so they were basically sitting ducks. But one thing that really stood out to me.

It was 130 years ago that Anatole France said:

“The law, in its majestic equality, forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal their bread.”

Reasoning: The commenter directly addresses the community's response to the court ruling, criticizing both current government policies and societal attitudes towards homelessness. They also make a historical reference to highlight what they perceive as hypocrisy and moral wrongdoing in treating homelessness as a criminal issue.

Reasoning: The comment questions the use of ""unhoused"" terminology, suggesting it's being used as an excuse for theft rather than its intended purpose of describing homelessness. This reflects a negative perception of those experiencing homelessness and implies they are deceptive, which can be seen as harmful generalization. However, there is no explicit or implicit racial bias present. The critique is more focused on the language used to describe homelessness rather than addressing money aid allocation, government policies, or specific solutions. Therefore, it falls under societal critique. Since the comment does not mention any race-related issues, it is classified as non-racist.

Reasoning: The commenter questions the effectiveness of providing housing for individuals experiencing homelessness, suggesting that addressing mental illness and drug use requires more than just housing. This implies a harmful generalization by assuming that simply providing housing will not solve these issues, which could lead to negative perceptions of those seeking assistance. However, there is no explicit or implicit racial bias present in the comment. The critique focuses on broader societal and governmental approaches rather than targeting any specific group. Therefore, it falls under both government and societal critique while also touching upon harmful generalizations. Additionally, the commenter does not make any racially charged statements, so it is classified as non-racist.

"""They can move along"" ""Street camping needs to be banned""

Definitely not jail, completely unnecessary.

Preferably PSR. Campers would be provided transport to the nearest camp or told to move along. 

> Street drugs have a lot to do with perpetrating homelessness and things have gotten uglier after 110 on the street level. 

How exactly would criminalization help? All that would do is take resources away from actual solutions like housing and addiction treatment.

There's no two ways about it. These people are lacking resources, we have *plenty* of resources, but poor government planning, spending, and regulation, combined with people who don't see the homeless as humans and simply want to kick them out, are keeping the resouces out of their hands. 

You know how when you live in a society, it's everyone's responsibility to pay taxes so we can have roads and schools? Well, as society is made up of humans and humans can't really do much without each others' help, it's also your responsibility to take care of each other. Look at the homeless people in your neighborhood. They are your neighbors whether they sleep in a house or a tent.

"Finland has universal healthcare that includes substance abuse and mental heathcare. The U.S. does not. 

Housing first in the U.S. works great for someone that is down on their luck, someone living in their car or couch surfing for a few weeks. It can get otherwise ok people back on their feet and back into a job. These are the invisible homeless that are not the problem we see on the streets. These are not the people that Solve is picking up literal tons of garbage after, these are not the drug users leaving needles in children's playgrounds. 

Housing first will not work with the chronic homeless without massive investments in drug programs and mental healthcare. The only change would be instead of a tent bike chop shop and drug den, it will be a tax payer subsidized apartment based bike chop shop and drug den. 

The very people that are the problem we see on the streets are still going to be a problem, they will just be a problem that is also contributing to the housing shortage. The only solution are mental hospitals where these people can be forced to receive the care they need. And as they get better they can be given more freedom and perhaps even jobs at the hospital where they can learn the skills to enter the public again.

"I'm from the east coast and I have to say there is really a huge disparity between homelessness on the east coast vs the west coast, particularly concerning the behaviors of these communities. Even in these major cities like NYC and DC, homelessness is not visibly as bad as it is in Portland — the homeless camps are so pervasive here, it's honestly quite shocking. Even in the SE, I was alarmed at how many people I saw sleeping on sidewalks, in entryways, on the stoops of churches, etc. There are syringes and human feces everywhere. You just don't see this on the east coast. Plus, many people in the homeless community in this area are rather aggressive and intimidating, whereas in places like NYC/DC/etc, they essentially just hold up signs and keep to themselves. 

I understand all of the facets that make Portland so attractive to those that are struggling with homelessness — mild climate, generous citizens, enabling government — but to compare the homeless communities of the PNW to those of the east is like comparing apples to oranges.

The comment suggests a mixed perception type due to both the positive aspect of making friends and the negative characterization of the homeless population.

Additionally, there's an element of harmful generalization towards the homeless community. No racist elements are present in the comment.

">""increased law enforcement"" implies people want more cops.

>Actual responses in the article suggest people want increased enforcement of laws.

How has this become the takeaway for people from this article? It's hardly the main point.

First of all, we need both - the cops we have need to do a better job of enforcing the laws, and we need more cops to cover more areas, more consistently, and to make sure there is sufficient availability for them to respond whenever a call for assistance comes in, even if it's not an immediate emergency. 

But the real issue here is something else entirely - that by a clear majority, people in this city are sick and tired of people simply being allowed to do whatever they want, wherever they want, without consequence. Not because they're not compassionate, not because they don't understand that many people who are homeless truly got there through no fault of their own or that most of us could relatively easily end up in the same situation, but because they realize that for those that struggle the most to make responsible choices, an overall approach that prioritizes permissiveness and enabling is the worst possible ""solution"" - for them and for the rest of us.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the economic impact of a business closing down and does not address any specific policy, solution, or perception related to homelessness. It also does not contain any racial biases. Therefore, it falls into neither the critique nor response category and does not fit into the perception types provided. However, there's a subtle implication that the previous business owners might have better fallback options than the homeless, which could be interpreted as a form of ""not in my backyard"" sentiment, though this is quite indirect. Given the lack of direct alignment with the provided categories, we classify it as 'none'.

Reasoning: The commenter provides personal observations and concerns about the challenges faced by people experiencing homelessness, including weather conditions, harassment, and lack of support networks. They also mention the impact of the pandemic, which is relevant but does not fit into any of the critique categories. There is no indication of racial bias in the comment. The focus on finding better shelter options and addressing the needs of individuals without family or friends suggests a desire for solutions. However, since there's no direct criticism of money aid allocation, government policies, or societal norms, these categories do not apply.

"Baltimore City has been housing homeless people in hotels throughout the pandemic. This program has been extended through June and will probably be extended through September.

 [Baltimore will keep homeless in hotels through June, but hasn’t tapped federal money set aside to pay for it](https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-baltimore-homeless-hotel-extension-20210408-lerftyk7azfyfbshyr6iorx2si-story.html)

>Baltimore will continue housing about 500 homeless residents in hotel rooms at least through June, extending a program designed to prevent the spread of COVID-19, even though it has not yet applied for $35 million in federal money that would pay for it. 

These hotels are probably not 5 star rated and the view may not be as nice as the Canton waterfront. However, it would seem to be much better than living in a tent long term. The hotels not only provide shelter and safety, but electricity, running water, bathrooms, heat, A/C, change of towels and bed linen and probably cable TV. 

It seems that there is a short term solution already in place for the few tents that have sprung up in Canton as well as longer term solutions that are being planned.

Reasoning: The comment critiques the societal perception that homelessness is solely due to individual faults rather than systemic issues. It also implies a harmful generalization by suggesting that individuals without access to shelters might choose not to use them because they believe it's their fault, which can perpetuate negative stereotypes about homeless individuals. However, there is no explicit or implicit racial bias present in the comment. To clarify, the comment does not directly address race, but it touches upon a harmful stereotype that could be applied to any group. Therefore, we classify it under ""Harmful Generalization"" and mark it as ""No"" for racial bias.

Reasoning: The commenter reports on local government's neglect towards homelessness and society's acceptance of this issue. They also make a harmful generalization by suggesting that locals become desensitized to crime due to prolonged exposure.
To further break down the reasoning:

- **Government Critique**: The statement ""we keep thousands of buildings boarded and abandoned just for spite"" implies criticism of local government policies or decisions.
- **Societal Critique**: The phrase ""you get used to it"" suggests a broader societal acceptance or normalization of homelessness and related issues.
- **Not in My Backyard**: The mention of keeping buildings abandoned indicates a preference for addressing the issue elsewhere rather than locally.
- **Harmful Generalization**: The implication that residents adapt to crime and homelessness suggests a negative stereotype about both the homeless population and the community’s response.
- **No Racial Bias**: There are no explicit or implicit racial references in the comment.

Comment Type: Reporting
Critique Category: Government Critique
Response Category: Solutions/Interventions
Perception Type: Media Portrayal
Racist: No
Reasoning: The commenter is sharing a link to an article about successful initiatives to end chronic homelessness, which indicates they are reporting on a topic rather than expressing their own views directly. They mention a specific community (Montgomery County) being featured in the article, suggesting interest in how such programs work. There's no indication of personal interaction, opposition to local developments, harmful generalizations, judgments about deservingness, or any form of racial bias. The focus appears to be on sharing information about potential solutions and interventions. Therefore, this falls under the category of reporting and includes elements of government critique and solutions discussion. The perception type is categorized as media portrayal since the commenter is referencing content from an external source. [End of formatted response]

Reasoning: The commenter provides firsthand experience of panhandling in Baltimore, suggesting that it's difficult to earn significant amounts of money through this method. They also express skepticism towards positive portrayals of panhandling earnings, which could be seen as a form of harmful generalization. There is no indication of racial bias in the comment. 

The critique touches on both the allocation of aid (through work-like activities) and societal perceptions of homelessness, but there are no proposed solutions or interventions discussed. Therefore, ""Response Category"" is left blank. The comment type is identified as ""Direct"" because the speaker shares their own observations and opinions about homelessness. 

Note: The term ""harmful generalization"" is used here based on the implication that positive portrayals of panhandling earnings do not reflect reality, potentially leading to inaccurate public perception. However, the comment itself does not explicitly generalize",1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0

Reasoning: The comment reports on a perceived negative stereotype of homeless individuals engaging in inappropriate behavior, which falls under harmful generalization. It also implies a critical view of how homelessness is portrayed in media, thus fitting into societal critique. There is no indication of racism in the comment. 

Note: The comment does not suggest any direct solution or intervention, hence it doesn't fall under the response category. The reference to ""The Other Guys"" suggests a media portrayal of homeless individuals, further supporting the perception type classification.

Reasoning: The commenter criticizes both government policies and societal structures, suggesting they believe these support a ""permanent homeless class."" They also make negative judgments about homeless individuals, implying they are drug-addicted and lazy (""no incentive to not be...""), which can be seen as harmful generalizations. However, there is no explicit or implicit racial bias present in this comment. The focus is on characterizing behaviors rather than attributing them to race. 

The comment does not propose any solutions or interventions, nor does it mention personal interactions or media portrayals. Instead, it emphasizes the perceived lack of incentives for self-sufficiency among homeless individuals and criticizes left-leaning policies. This aligns more closely with societal critiques and government policy critiques rather than direct reporting or solution-oriented discussions.

Reasoning: The commenter discusses the healthcare system's approach to homelessness, suggesting that those who are ""incidentally"" homeless might receive more immediate assistance compared to those who are ""chronically"" homeless. This implies judgment based on perceived deservingness, which falls under the ""deserving/undeserving"" category. There is no explicit or implicit racial bias mentioned. The comment also indirectly critiques both governmental programs and societal perceptions by highlighting the differences in treatment between different types of homeless individuals. The suggestion that chronic homelessness may have underlying reasons indicates a call for further investigation or intervention, fitting into the ""solutions/interventions"" category.

Mayor's Statement

> BALTIMORE, MD. -- Like everyone in our city, state and across this nation, we mourned the senseless killing of Jacquelyn Smith. To now learn that family members staged this brutal killing is beyond belief and represents a double tragedy. They were responsible for taking Jacquelyn's life with unconscionable cruelty, and contrived to do so in our city under the guise of random violence, exploiting the legitimate fears of our residents. I commend our homicide detectives for their expert and tireless work in bringing those truly responsible to justice in this very troubling and sad case.

"I feel like this housing trust is a bit ridiculous.  We already fund a ton of public housing in this city and rents in this city are already some of the cheapest on the east coast.   Things like this also often spend a ton of money to help relatively few people.

What we need is more supply- cut the red tape and loosen restrictions for parking and in some cases historic code to increase the supply of new units coming on board.  Yesterday's new housing is today's affordable housing.

A great analogy- Think about who buys new cars versus used cars. It's not all that different. Yet, as Joe Cortright points out, ""There's no outcry about America's affordable car crisis""—because America has plenty of affordable cars, just not affordable brand new cars.

Perception Type: Not in my Backyard
Racist: No
Reasoning: The commenter is questioning another user's pessimism about the situation of homeless individuals lining up for assistance, suggesting they view this as a positive development. They also imply skepticism towards the idea of providing more housing, which can be seen as a form of government critique. There is no indication of personal interaction, media portrayal, opposition to local developments, harmful generalizations, or judgments about deservingness. The comment does not contain any explicit or implicit racial bias. Therefore, there is no racist classification.

Reasoning: The commenter discusses the lack of proper care for someone experiencing homelessness due to systemic issues (""Baltimore works she probably didn't get the help she needs""), suggesting criticism of both governmental and societal responses. They also express concern over the individual's worsening condition due to homelessness, indicating a perception of harmful generalizations about the negative impacts of homelessness. There is no indication of racial bias in the comment. The suggestion of mental health facilities and better support services points towards a desire for solutions. The mention of personal interaction through ""I hope she went to a mental health facility"" further supports this categorization.

With that being said, you have no idea what you’re talking about. As far as I know the shelter system sucks. Mental health treatment is even worse (best case scenario is you get a week or 2 in Shepherd Pratt and get dumped back on the street but that’s only after like a major psychotic episode). Both housing and healthcare are expensive which is no good for homeless people, in fact it’s probably why their homeless. And your blaming their family? You’re blaming the homeless for having to use the bathroom but not having public facilities? Where would you use the bathroom if you were homeless? What would you do? Do have no empathy? Because there but for the grace of god goes yourself. But of course you have lots empathy for Target.

TLDR you have lots of complaints but no solutions. You should just say you don’t like the homeless and you want them forcibly removed from your presence and leave it at that.

"I really appreciate your car and concern for your homeless neighbors. However It’s not your job to solve an individuals problems that they aren’t asking to be solved. If they are asking for money or food, give them that. Trying to solve an individuals problems that they haven’t asked for is condescending and smacks of saviorism. 

If you want to help deal with the structural issues that lead to homelessness then do that on a systemic level. Advocate for increased spending on mental health, veterans care, addiction resources. Fight against things that increase homelessness like non violent drug law sentencing, loitering laws, etc.

"This is a good point. I'm not sure if you're using this as an argument that people WANT segregation, or if you're just pointing out something you've seen, but the idea of gentrification brings attention to how out-of-balance things are. 

Gentrification is fucking awesome to people who own property, right? Like - if I bought a home for $40k and suddenly that neighborhood became the place to be, I'd be pumped to earn over 1000% on my investment over a few years. 

But let's face it: **Gentrification is happening in places where the people living there do NOT own property.** They're tenants renting someone else's property. The ""kind"" landlords will raise rent to merely catch up with tax assessments and basic inflation, the rest of them will go ""the market value has changed"" (I put ""kind"" in quotes because very, very, very few landlords are anything but exploitative). 

***

So when we look at answering questions about systemic racism and living/property costs and wealth, a few things come up:

- Generational wealth is a concept that has positively impacted whites at a higher rate than BIPOC. Everything from slavery to Jim Crow to redlining so every other flavor of systemic racism, the privilege of building and passing on generational wealth isn't afforded to many BIPOC. Escaping the poverty loop is hard enough - and when you don't have generational wealth to build/pass on, you're stuck renting and hoping you don't get gentrified out of your living situation.
 - With no generational wealth, you greatly reduce the likelihood that the affected person can purchase a home
 - YES - white people deal with this too, albeit on a less-proportional level, and without the many other roadblocks. It needs to be understood that certain measures that may benefit BIPOC may benefit whites in this same position...
- Accessibility to homes for those who might actually be in a position to purchase is waning. If you're BIPOC from the east side and you want to remain in the community you grew up in, you might be looking at the east side. You might find something that's within your price range. You might also learn that your home's value may not appreciate faster than the rate of inflation because of where you are.
 - ""Crime!"" some of the neolibs and conservatives will cry. ""It's that way because of crime! Fix the crime and values will go up!"" Perhaps - but tell me how much that value actually goes up when the sounds of the 33 drown out your backyard BBQ.
 - Hidden barriers. Aside from the pseudo-redlining that still happens among BIPOC, those $40,000 homes on the east side often require additional money to make them comfortably habitable. 
- NIMBY will always be a huge roadblock. Every time anyone ever mentions ""affordable housing"" - whether it's an income-based apartment complex or some allocation for some affordable path to home ownership, people make a stink. They will fight for ""those people"" to go back to to the place they belong and then use every dog whistle, holier-than-thou argument, and sob story about how the safety of their neighborhood is at risk.",buffalo,Direct/Reporting,Money Aid Allocation/Government Critique/Societal Critique,Solutions/Interventions,"Personal Interaction/Media Portrayal/Not in My Backyard/Harmful Generalization/Deserving/Undeserving

Perception Type: [Hidden Barriers, Generational Wealth, Property Costs]
Racist: [Yes]
Reasoning: The comment discusses systemic issues related to race and housing, including generational wealth disparities and hidden barriers faced by BIPOC. While it does not directly express negative views towards individuals experiencing homelessness, it implicitly critiques societal structures and policies that disproportionately affect marginalized communities. The term ""NIMBY"" (Not In My Backyard) is used to describe opposition to affordable housing initiatives, which can be associated with resistance to addressing homelessness. Additionally, phrases like ""white people deal with this too, albeit on a less-proportional level"" suggest a comparison that could be perceived as minimizing the unique challenges faced by BIPOC. Therefore, while not explicitly racist, the comment contains elements that could be interpreted as reinforcing racial biases.

"Buffalo isn't as cheap for housing as people say. Apparently they haven't rented an apartment or room in EV or Allen in awhile. If they did they would know at those prices you usually only get a craphole.

Jobs here are great if you know people, if you social network you can make money in this town. If you are secluded and keep to yourself chances are you will only make min wage or just above.

There is a huge income disparity in Buffalo(the city not burbs).
I have found myself homeless here twice in recent years. 

Once because of a job that closed (Collections). Another time because I rented one of those *reasonably* priced apartments and dealt with a crazy landlord who would often come into my apartment. Sometimes when I was home, others when I was not home. That's just the start of it.

(Disclaimer: Being white and educated doesn't mean you aren't poor, a lot of people are educated here and job competition is vicious.)
I am white.
I have a 2 year degree.
I do smoke pot, so that has definitely been a huge obstacle for me to overcome in regards to professional jobs.
But other than that I do not drink, take pills or other drugs.

So other than that, Buffalo can be a great city to live in.
But the downsides are the nepotism, cold, income disparity, high rental prices, lack of reasonable bus system(that arrives on time or to the suburbs), jobs(blue collar/non-union).

Oh, and if you have any issues with credit good luck renting anywhere corporate. I was a unlucky individual with a awesome mother who used my info for utilities and other bills that makes renting that way near impossible. 

I'm not knocking Buffalo, but it has some serious issues and I just wanted to offer an alternative perspective from my lifelong episode of poverty and snow.

GL and Welcome to Buffalo.

Edit: Oh yeah try to avoid temp agencies as it is a bit of a footsie game and often employs you in revolving door employment opportunities.

"The issue isn’t that the use of demolition: it was the indiscriminate use of demolition without consideration or alternative or long term plan, and worse, that it continued even as Buffalo began its “renaissance” and through to this day.

"And they're asking people to donate food, clothing, and baby supplies -- not tents. As a lifelong democrat, no I am not universally opposed to social programs.

The reality is that the OP could donate the tent and camping supplies to a local nonprofit that could make good use of it. This is not as flashy or righteous as giving it to LGBTQ homeless people. The best outcome is someone pops a tent on the sidewalk, neighbors and local businesses call police immediately because encampments are not normalized here, and the tent is thrown in the trash. Worst outcome is someone pops the tent on private property and they are verbally/physically threatened before their tent is thrown away.

You can empathize with the homeless and gladly pay taxes to support people. You don't have to allow encampments to spring up in public places. You let that fester long enough under good intentions and you turn into SF or Seattle. Look up the months long skirmishes between police and activists over clearing encampments in Cal Anderson Park in Seattle.

"The 1950s has almost 0 relevance to this conversation; cost of living is astronomically higher, while real wages have been stagnant for most of the 70 years between then and now. The housing crisis is an *affordability* crisis, and increasing supply across the board is a strategy to solve it.

Not everywhere needs to have middle density housing options, but you also don't want to completely suburbanize parts of the East Side with single-family homes, especially when it means higher utility costs and greenhouse gas emissions per capita. 

I'd also push back on the idea there was no housing crisis in the 1950s, since urban renewal efforts targeting ""overcrowded"" black neighborhoods began soon after WWII, as black renters were not allowed in many ""higher end"" (white) neighborhoods. So an actually colorblind housing market might have seen higher demand for density outside of downtown if black urbanites could choose where they were able to build their lives.",buffalo, , , ,"

Or maybe you're just rationalizing to find a reason to dismiss an entire class of people in need, to make yourself feel better about not helping.

Many cities in Siberia are pretty small and compact and the giant apartment block buildings are stacked tightly concentrated in areas to give people very cheap housing (or free if they inherited them from the Soviet era). We should do the same. 5 to 8 story apartment block buildings. Pack people into one bedroom and two bedroom units for free or cheap. That would end homelessness and the housing crisis.

Reasoning: The comment focuses on property rights and responsibilities without expressing any direct views about people experiencing homelessness. It does not discuss money aid allocation, criticize government policies, or address societal attitudes towards homelessness. The commenter's perspective seems more aligned with property ownership and maintenance rather than directly addressing homeless individuals or systemic issues related to homelessness. Therefore, no critique category or response category applies here. The perception type ""Not in my Backyard"" is relevant because the comment discusses how property owners might not have to actively manage their properties due to seasonal use, which could indirectly relate to concerns about unmanaged properties becoming shelters for homeless individuals. However, this is not explicitly stated, so it remains inferred. There is no indication of racial bias in the comment.

"New York State is a right to shelter state so DSS has to place you somewhere if you go during normal hours and are homeless. If it’s after hours, 211 basically will just give you a hotel placement for one night, or three nights if it’s Friday night, just enough to get you to be able to go to DSS to get a shelter placement. Code Blue had started technically, but the low-barrier shelters at 586 Genesee Street and Salvation Army on Main St that you can just show up at 5:30 on a given night are only open if the temp is going to drop below 32°.

You can follow up with his counselor, but most likely what they did is fill out what is called a SPOA application. This will put him on a waitlist for subsidized housing based on his diagnosis. What you would basically be hoping for with that is some OMH funded program that doesn’t require homeless time, since he won’t have any under HUD standards until he is “literally homeless” by staying in a shelter or on the street. He can’t fill out a VI-SPDAT until he meets the “literally homeless” definition that I mentioned before, and that would put him on a waitlist for a rapid rehousing program or a subsidized HUD-funded program.

There is no indication of racial bias in the comment. The suggestion for policy change indicates a focus on government critique, while the concern over rising housing prices reflects a societal critique.

To clarify, the term ""harmful generalization"" refers to making broad statements about a group based on limited information, which can lead to prejudice and discrimination. In this case, the phrase suggests that homeless individuals are picky or ungrateful, which is a stereotype that can contribute to negative perceptions and treatment of those experiencing homelessness.

However, if the landlord is absentee and doesn't notice and the person is there for more than 30 days, then they get tenants rights and have to go through the standard eviction process. The squatter can still get removed via the eviction process. The squatter doesn't get ownership over the property. That takes 10 years of adverse possession.

Reasoning: The comment is reporting on how discussions about homelessness are being perceived, comparing current events to a fictional episode from South Park. This suggests criticism of how society is framing the issue rather than expressing direct views or offering solutions. There is no indication of personal interaction, opposition to local developments, or judgments based on race or deservingness. The comparison itself does not imply any racial bias. Therefore, it falls under societal critique and media portrayal.

Let's break down the comment step by step:

**Comment Analysis:**

- **Comment Type:** This comment is describing a situation where a ""homeless bus"" (likely referring to a mobile shower or sanitation service) is used to clean up the area around a food pantry due to the presence of homeless individuals.
  
- **Critique Category:** The comment does not directly discuss money aid allocation, government policies, or broader societal critiques related to homelessness. It focuses on a practical observation rather than critiquing any system or policy.

- **Response Category:** While the comment doesn't explicitly suggest a solution, it implies that the use of the homeless bus is a response to the issue at hand, which can be seen as an intervention.

- **Perception Type:** The comment mentions a direct personal experience (""happens all the time"") and discusses the impact of the homeless population on the environment and cleanliness of the area. There is no mention of media portrayals, opposition to local developments, or judgments about deservingness.

Perception Type: Not in my Backyard
Racist: No
Reasoning: The comment reports on the focus of a town hall meeting and mentions Abbott's potential decision regarding migrants based on proximity to another state. It does not directly express personal views about people experiencing homelessness but rather discusses how policy decisions might be influenced by geographical factors. The perception type ""Not in my Backyard"" applies as the commenter suggests that Abbott might not bring migrants closer to Texas due to local concerns. There is no indication of racial bias in this comment. 

Note: The original comment did not explicitly mention race, so we cannot classify it under racist without additional context suggesting racial bias. Therefore, the classification remains 'No'. If there were any racial slurs or implications, it would have been classified as 'Yes'. However, given the provided text, no such elements are present.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Neither the Hawaii nor NY program are about simply dumping people but, the idea of sending homeless people to Hawaii which has a very serious homeless problem to begin with did not sit well with residents.

Reasoning: The comment reports on a program in Hawaii and New York related to homelessness without expressing personal opinions or advocating for specific solutions. It mentions concerns from residents about the impact of such programs on local communities and provides information about the homeless situation in Hawaii, indicating both societal critique and media portrayal perceptions. There is no indication of racial bias. 

Note: The original comment does not explicitly mention any racial issues, so we classify it as ""No"" for racist content. However, homelessness disproportionately affects certain racial groups, which might imply underlying biases in society's treatment of different racial groups.

"Someone mentioned gas stations, and I second that advice.

I have several friends whi are mangers at different DK gas stations and give homeless regulars  a ""job"" which is really just taking out the garbage and keeping the outside of the store clean in exchange for hot food that they are going to toss anyway, and even water and coffee. As long as they don't scare the customers away by hanging out/sleeping/begging on the premises, it works out well.

One of them had a woman who was outside of his store for two years, rain or shine, in heat or cold. Her son was in prison, and she was trying to raise money to get an apartment for herself and him so that he would have a place to go when he got out. She was very friendly and never asked anyone for money outright - just would give a friendly ""hi"" and have a nice day.And if people gave her money, she would thank them, and she saved every penny - never used any on herelf so my friend let her get water/food from inside. I would stop and chat with her sometimes, that's how I know why she was out there. My friend let her stay out there all the way until she had the money to get her own place. I remember the last time I saw her, she updated me and told me she had got a place and was now trying to find some cheap furniture. I haven't seen her out there since, so  I'm glad that she made it.

My other friend who manages another DK, had a guy there who he exchanged food and drinks for cleaning up the outside of the property and emptying the trash.  That worked out well for about a year and a half. I would see this guy there all the time and it worked out well for both of them until recently -  he had to finally kick the guy out because he started bringing his friends who were  addicts and they started building a makeshift house on the side of the building and were kind of creeping the customers out.

But yeah, if you go inside and talk to the managers of one of these gas stations, a lot of them will work something out  with you.",elpaso,Direct/Reporting,"Money Aid Allocation, Government Critique, Societal Critique",Solutions/Interventions,"Personal Interaction, Media Portrayal, Not in my Backyard, Harmful Generalization, Deserving/Undeserving

Reasoning: The comment differentiates between ""homeless"" and ""transients,"" implying that some transients are not truly homeless and may pose a danger. This can lead to harmful generalizations about certain groups within the broader category of homelessness. Additionally, the commenter shares a personal experience or observation, suggesting caution when encountering individuals they perceive as potentially dangerous. However, there is no explicit or implicit racial bias present in the comment. To clarify further, the term ""transient"" is used in a way that could imply these individuals are transiently homeless rather than permanently so, which might contribute to harmful perceptions. The advice given also reflects a personal interaction-based perspective on how to navigate encounters with such individuals.

Reasoning: The commenter is reporting on observations of homelessness in different areas and making assumptions about the causes of homelessness based on perceived demographics. They generalize that ""homers"" were pushed out by migrants and suggest that certain areas are dominated by either migrants or long-term homeless individuals. This reflects a societal critique of how homelessness is perceived and discussed within communities, but does not explicitly address money aid allocation or government policies. There is no indication of explicit or implicit racial bias in this comment. However, the use of terms like ""homers"" could be seen as derogatory and may contribute to harmful generalizations about groups of people. Therefore, it falls under the category of harmful generalization rather than racism.

"it puts into perspective how fucked our country is and how dirty it does the population. We have a homeless epidemic, I'm lucky enough to be in a position where I can help and often volunteer about once a month or so, I've seen first hand how many we have and the fact that its considered a good low number is twisted. Obviously Texas has a significantly better government than California and New York so it isn't as bad here as there but our numbers should be what those two states experience and ours should be near nonexistent. 

  
Japan has managed to essentially eradicate homelessness with a worse GDP to population than we have, no excuses for the USA to not have done the same thing. Being in a profit over humanity country really sucks sometimes. We got all the money in the world to give to useless foreign countries that do not help us and set up camps for migrants who will never see citizenship because we've designed it as a tax write off instead of an immigration point, but none to spend to help our people, not just with homelessness but education, healthcare, and literally everything under the sun all the way down to school supplies for teachers.

Reasoning: The comment directly addresses the speaker's views on the relationship between affordable housing and crime, challenging common perceptions often found in media portrayals. It references multiple sources to support its argument against the notion that affordable housing leads to increased crime rates. There is no indication of racial bias in the comment.

Reasoning: The commenter discusses the lack of accessible infrastructure and public transportation in El Paso, which affects homeless individuals. They suggest that better infrastructure could improve living conditions for those experiencing homelessness. This falls under direct commentary on government policy and infrastructure, which is a form of government critique. There are no perceptions or racist elements in this comment. 

Note: The original comment does not explicitly mention any solutions or interventions, but it can be inferred that the suggestion of better infrastructure and public transportation is a solution to the problem being discussed. Therefore, ""Solutions/Interventions"" has been included based on this inference. If more context were provided, this might change.
